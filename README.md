# Bitcoin-Price-Alert-
**### Objective:**
It is not necessary that the Bitcoin price always stays high. Sometimes it rises and sometimes it falls so why not build a system that tells us when it rises and when it falls.

**Hardware required:**

1 x Bolt IoT Module

1 x Micro USB Cable

1 x  Buzzer

2 x Female to male wires


A) To build the Bitcoin Price Alerting system, we will require a method to find the current price of Bitcoin by writing a Python program. We will use the following website https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ to get the price of Bitcoin. On this website all currencies are called as symbols or “sym” in short. You will use the Single Symbol Price API to get the price of Bitcoin in USD or INR etc.

B) Connect the buzzer to your Bolt module. The buzzer will be switched ON when the current price of the Bitcoin is greater than the selling price defined by you.


C) Python program:
